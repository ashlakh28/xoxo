            I made this instead of sending a normal text.
            That alone should entertain you a little.

            You have this calm, easy energy.
            It makes conversations feel lighter.
            I really like that about you.

            Because I haven't known you long,
            but I already look forward to talking to you.
            And this felt cuter than just saying it.

            that was the whole point. 🌷
